        Teachers and instructors expect your papers to be error-free. But let's face it, 
        even native English speakers are prone to silly mistakes.
         That's why proofreading is absolutely critical in ensuring your work is perfect.
        Yes, even expert writers sometimes get tripped up over the details of English. 
        If you work with an editor, little blips aren't that important.
         If you have to edit your own work, our automated proofreading tool is your new best friend.
        <h2>The Danger of Bad Grammar</h2> 
        Even in these days of text speak, 120-character thoughts, and casual blogging, grammar and spelling still count. We believe the ideas expressed are more important, but these ideas may not reach anyone if they're delivered messily.
        Hence, poor grammar can affect your career. Many studies have proven that poor communication on the job causes bad impressions, errors, delays, and lost clients or deals.
        Off the clock, communication problems lead to distrust and misunderstandings. And if youâ€™re a student, English errors result in low marks. Whatever the case, we can help you prevent those errors.
        Take a look at our infographics and blog for easy but detailed explanations of even hard-to-grasp topics. In a hurry? Use our online grammar and spell checker, and in a minute, you'll be certain that you're putting out quality material for your readers
